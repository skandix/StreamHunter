# StreamHunter

The purpose of this project is to learn about how streams work, and what to do with a m3u8 playlist. And then how to merge files together to make it playablee.

# Usage
the script isn't very functional at the moment, everything seems to work except for the merging of the "TransportStreams". 
but everything else of parsing the m3u8 files is working great as to the streams i've tested.
